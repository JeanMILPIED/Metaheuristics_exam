# Metaheuristics_exam
my work for DSTI A19 metaheuristics exam

## 1. structure of the reports
In each folder, one can find the python Jupyter notebook to run the optimisation of the problem, and the image of the solutions.   
The solutions to the problems are shared in this readme.

## 2. Problem solutions
### 2.1 TSP - Djibouti
The thinking process is highly described in the Jupyter notebook.

### 2.2 TSP - Qatar
The same algorithm is used as for Djibouti.  
The performance achieved is correct with smart initialisation + generation of random solutions + SImulated annealing to overcome local mimimums.

### 2.3 F1 - Shifted Sphere Function
we use a simple minimize function with gradient algo.

### 2.4 F2 - Shifted Schwefel’s Problem 2.21

### 2.5 F3 - Shifted Rosenbrock’s Function

### 2.6 F4 - Shifted Rastrigin’s Function

### 2.7 F5 - Shifted Griewank’s Function

### 2.8 F6 - Shifted Ackley’s Function
